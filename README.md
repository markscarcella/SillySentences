# SillySentences
A silly little python gui that can generate simple sentences such as "The smelly dog jumps occasionally."

Basic program adds a window with a title, background, button, and text box. Clicking the button generates a sentence of the form "The <adjective> <noun> <verb> <adverb>.", which can be extended if you like!

Coding concepts covered:
  - Variables (eg. window)
  - Attributes (eg. window.title)
  - Functions (eg. generateSentence)
  - Lamda (hah! just kidding, but there is one in there but I'd just say it's needed to pass an argument :))
  - Lists (eg. nouns = ["man","dog"])
  - Random (eg. random.choose(nouns))
  - Maths (placing background at 0,0, setting x,y size, etc)
  
Can be easily expanded by adding more buttons to generate different sentences? Change colour, position, size, font. Add audio? Lots of room for fun (I hope!).

Take it slow, and explore each point. The learners have already done some Python so they should be semi-familiar.
